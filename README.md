Built a linear regression-based predictive model to estimate cubic zirconia stone prices using attributes like carat, cut, color, and clarity, improving accuracy through multicollinearity treatment and feature engineering.  </i><br>

### ðŸ“˜ Description:
This project aimed to help a gemstone manufacturer predict price ranges of cubic zirconia stones based on physical and categorical attributes. Using a dataset of ~27,000 samples, the project involved:
- Exploratory analysis of stone properties like carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and dimensions
- Detection and handling of outliers, null values, and multicollinearity
- Grouping ordinal categories (e.g., clarity and cut) for modeling consistency
- Encoding, scaling, and regression modeling using both scikit-learn and statsmodels
- Built and compared 5 regression models with varying features to optimize performance
- Final model achieved high RÂ² (~0.93) and low RMSE (~910) on test data
- Provided a business-ready equation for price prediction based on carat, cut, color, and clarity

This project demonstrates my ability to apply classical regression modeling, data cleaning, feature transformation, and multicollinearity analysis to real-world business data.

ðŸ“… Timeline: January 2022

ðŸ“¦ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Linear Regression, VIF, RMSE, RÂ²
